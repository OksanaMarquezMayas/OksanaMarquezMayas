About Me

## I'm a passionate and motivated manual QA Engineer with a strong foundation in testing principles and a growing skillset. With 6 months of total experience in software testing, I've spent the last 2 months actively working as a freelancer on platforms like Testbirds, UTest, and TesterWork. During this freelance time, I've honed my skills in identifying and reporting software defects across various applications.

My Strengths:

## Testing Fundamentals: Adept in applying different testing techniques (e.g., black-box, exploratory) and methodologies (e.g., agile) to ensure software quality.
Testing Tools: Proficient in using project management tools like Jira, Trello, Mantis, TestRail for seamless test case organization and reporting.
Technical Skills: Possess a strong understanding of API testing with tools like Postman and Swagger. Can navigate databases using SQL and perform load testing with JMeter.
Basic Programming Knowledge: Familiar with web development fundamentals like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Understanding of scripting languages like Python and data formats like JSON and XML adds value to my testing approach.
Teamwork: Successfully collaborated on a team project testing the TaskPro application, contributing to improved test management practices.
I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a tester. I'm excited to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to the success of your project.
